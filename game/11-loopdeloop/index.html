    Loop-de-Loop
  </h1>
  <p><p>Loop-de-Loop is a free-for-all party game in which players must fly through loops and reach the end of the course as fast as possible! A player can get fireworks back after depleting them by failing or going through a ring. </p>
<p>There is additionally a &quot;Flappy Loop&quot; version, which plays similar to Flappy Bird, but in 3D! </p>
