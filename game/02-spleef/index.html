    Spleef
  </h1>
  <p><p>Spleef is a free-for-all game in which players must dig out the blocks beneath another player's feet, forcing them to fall to lower levels and, eventually, into lava!</p>
<p>The game can involve varying blocks such as snow, ice, magma, and slime/honey blocks, which all introduce interesting twists to gameplay.
In some modes, blocks will decay behind players, and in others, players will receive snowballs which they can use to destroy blocks from a distance.</p>
