King of the Hill is a free-for-all party game in which players compete to become the "King of the Hill" (however, people of any identity can play this game). Standing on a capture point gives points, and the person with the most points at the end of the time limit wins. 

There is also a "Deathmatch Mode" which is based on the last-player-standing, where the first player to win three rounds wins.
