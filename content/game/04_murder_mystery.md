Murder Mystery is a semi-team-based game in which **Detectives** must shoot the **Murderer** before they kill all of the **Innocent** players! If the **Detective** is murdered, an **Innocent** player is able to pick up their bow. If the **Detective** shoots the wrong person, they may die as well. **Innocent** players can additionally gather coins, which, when they accumulate enough, grants them an arrow that they can use to shoot the **Murderer**.
