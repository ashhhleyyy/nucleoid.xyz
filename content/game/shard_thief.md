Shard Thief is a free-for-all party game in which players must try and hold the **Prismarine Shards**! You can make a player drop their shard by shooting with a bow or punching them. Once they drop their shard, a prismarine block appears on the ground which you can stand on to pick up. If the shard is held by a single player for long enough, they win!
