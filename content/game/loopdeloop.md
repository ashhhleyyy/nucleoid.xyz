Loop-de-Loop is a free-for-all party game in which players must fly through loops and reach the end of the course as fast as possible! A player can get fireworks back after depleting them by failing or going through a ring. 

There is additionally a "Flappy Loop" version, which plays similar to Flappy Bird, but in 3D!
