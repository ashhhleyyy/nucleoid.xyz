Welcome to our blog! This is the first post in our new development updates section- and it hopefully will be the first of many to come!

This post, very excitingly, marks the readiness of our new website! The website now features a games list, contributors list, and development updates feed- all of which will hopefully serve to better document the exciting work that is being done by Nucleoid contributors.

In the future, we plan to document here any updates that develop with the project. It is not yet clear how we want to schedule these posts, but the current idea is to ideally have a post every week that details the progress that contributors made within that week.

If you are interested in contributing to or just following the project, check out our [Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) and [GitHub](https://github.com/NucleoidMC)!
